# Yet another simulator chair

## Abstract 

This is an open source simulator project where an IKEA chair has been modified into a dual control joystick. The main purpose is to offer a possibility to train students in for example Condor flight simulatior. From the basic flight training, to fine tuning the art thermalling and cross country. All in reach for the reasonable DIY-handy individual.

## Background

This project is sprung from the disappointment of using a joystick bought from an electronics store for 120€. Being a glider pilot for the last +30 years I do become annoyed when I can´t catch the thermals properly in the Condor gliding simulator. Or at least I blamed the joystick.

I started to think outside the box: How can I do this better with a reasonable budget? This page is my answer to this question.

After a few prototypes I landed in a solution where a control assembly is mounted on a chair. The prototypes proved that adequate control was feasible with surprisingly good flight control dynamics: you tend to forget that you are in a simulator when using a VR-headset. 

_The first example in the prototype series are being built._

The second iteration is utilising an Arduino Micro and hall sensors for the flight controls. Then an idea emerged of creating a more comfortable solution which can be reproduced larger numbers and how simulators can be a part of pilot training, especially for us who lives in a country that only allow flight from April to October.

The requirements for the simulator:
 - The parts shall be available in general stores (as far as possible)
 - A simple yet durable construction
 - Dual controlStick, rudder and airbrake
 - Airbrake shall be able to be used as throttle and collector after minor alteration
 - Tow cable release
 - Position of pedals are adjustable

## Electronics, "the magic stuff"

The electronics and software package that will simulate a joystick using the built-in drivers in Windows. Either you can get the stuff in the bill of materials, put things together and apply the Arduino libraries. Or feel free to use it as a creative compass for your own build.

The skill level required is an average glider pilot with limited soldering skill. After all this aren’t rocket science, just simulator sience.

The electronics and software package contains of:
 - Design schematic (open source) for Arduino Leonardo or Arduino Micro (ATMEGA32U4)
 - Software and libraries (open source)
 - Bill of material for recommended components to order 

Please note: firstI used potentiometers which broke pretty much instantly. Since then hall sensors are used which works excellent. So, if you are opting for potentiometers, please be aware of the potential limitations.

To make things easier I have developed a bespoke PCB-adaptor between Arduino and electrical connectors as well as a bespoke PCB-adaptor for the hall sensors recommended in the bill of material. Eventually you will be able to order these PCB´s.

## Flight control assembly

The flight control assembly is designed to fit onto a [POÄNG](https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/cat/poaeng-serie-07472/) from IKEA. Please see the blue prints in the DXF-folder in the file repository above for the pieces to cut out. Above you will also find a list of material to buy in the local hardware store (hinges, washers, nuts, screws, bicycle parts etc.)

We plan to offer a kit with CNC-cutout parts from plywood but this is progress right now. Meanwhile, if you have access to a CNC-machine or a laser cutter, please feel free to download the DXF-files and make simulator youself.

Installing the electronics

In order to install the hall sensors, a few 3D printed items has been developed. Please find the STL-files in the above repository.
